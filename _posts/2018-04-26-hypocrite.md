title: "The problem with ideals"

I am the guy who uses containers when using web services offered by evil internet companies (to protect my 'privacy'). But after looking at a few FOSS music players for Android, my *Ideals* went for a toss. Now I am a happy user of Google Play Music. My saving grace is the fact that I *Would* have used VLC, had it been available. Apparently, it is a nightmare to port.
