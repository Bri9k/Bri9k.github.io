And so it begins. The great blogging of our times. This is the *<insert number here>*th blog I have created. I hope I will actually get around to writing a post beyond this customary introduction. This customary introduction I am writind in vim, and it apparently understands markdown as well. *I am showing off !* It is also #poweredbyjekyll and #oncoolgitpages. I hate #s. Believe me. And to be on the safe side, I will *not* reveal th e name of me (a Nameless Evil) before actually writing a few more posts. Once I have, this self derogatory post will just be awsome self-derogatory humour. *evil laughter* More laughter. Hopefully from the reader.
